# Quantum Supremacy With Random Quantum Circuit Sampling

"Quantum supremacy" or "quantum advantage" is the potential ability of quantum computing devices to solve problems that classical computers practically cannot
... regardless if the task is of practical or interesting or not.  

We have implemented the random circuit sampling algorithm described in [arXiv:1608.00263](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00263) and reproduced the Porter-Thomas distribution for sufficiently large repetitions of the random circuit. We then did a mini experiment on Rigetti's quantum computer.
